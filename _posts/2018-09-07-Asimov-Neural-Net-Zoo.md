There is so much I want to do with neural networks.  But that would be impossible without standing on the shoulders of so many great people who have already been in the field of Artificial Intelligence much longer than I have.

One goal I have is to begin by studying each network in [Asimov Institute's](https://asimovinstitute.org) chart I have stolen, plagierized, swiped, from their amazing website.

One thing I appreciate about so many people in this field is their passion to share knowledge for the greater good of all.  Often you hear Ted talks not only about amazing things impossible until recently that happening now or are coming in the very near future, but many share concerns, potential dangers, how to avert those risks, and how to encourage this technology to grow in the direction of extending the abilities of people rather than replacing people.  Many work not on eliminating doctors but helping doctors save lives, for instance by recognizing cancer sooner, detecting strokes sooner, detecting pneumonia and saving lives.

# H2 The Neural Network Zoo as a Rubric

When I want to make sure I have learned something well, I like to create a rubric or a checklist.  And I have found [Asimov Institute's chart of neural nets](https://asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/) to be an excellent rubric.  But I have also found their website to provide an excellent, short, concise introduction to each kind of network from Frank Rosenblatt's original paper on the Perceptron written in 1958 to Hopfield Networks, Boltzmann machines, Markov Chains, Autoencoders, and all that you see in the chart above.

I expect it will take time before I will understand at a deep level how to use or apply each network well.  If you wish to dive into this world of Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, this is a great place to start.  When you want to go a little further, you may want to try some easy courses from [Fast.ai](https://fast.ai) or [Udemy](https://udemy.com).  If you are ready for a full commitment to studying and mastering the basics of Neural Neworks at a deeper level and are not afraid of digging into the math, linear algebra, basic calculus, then I heartily recommend taking [Andrew Ng's and Geoffrey Hinton's courses on Neural Networks and Artificial Intelligence through Coursera](https://coursera.com).

Two other websites I heartily recommend are [Kaggle](https://kaggle.org) and [KDNuggets](https://kdnuggets.org).

If you are interested in getting into self-driving vehicles, I recommend googling for Lex Friedman at MIT and watching his videos on YouTube.
